Juyoung Wang (왕주영, 王主榮) is a data scientist at [acrossB](https://www.acrossb.net). Academically, he is a Ph.D. dropout (after one year of study) and Master of Applied Science degree (supervisors: [Merve Bodur](https://sites.google.com/site/mervebodr/) and [Mucahit Cevik](https://people.ryerson.ca/mcevik/)) holder from Industrial and Systems Engineering at University of Toronto . He obtained his Bachelor's degree from Institute for Mathematical and Computational Engineering of Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

His research interests include both mathematical optimization and statistics, and their intersections such as statistical learning (both non-deep and deep learning) and explainable AI. Juyoung also has worked on a variety of applied topics such as healthcare, sales time series forecasting applied to revenue optimization, transportation and logistics.
